## Code examples
**Example 1.** Implement the filterString () function, which accepts a string and a character as input, and returns a new string in which the passed character has been deleted in all its positions.

```
const filterString = (str, simbol) => {  
  let i = 0;                
  let result = '';                
  while (i < str.length) {                    
      if (str[i] !== simbol) {       
        result = result + str[i];
      }                 
   i++;   
   }    
  return result;    
}
  ```
                        
**Example 2.** The numbers a and b are given. Print a string with numbers from a to b separated by spaces. It is known that b is greater than a.

```
function testCycle(a, b) {
  var x = '';
  b > a;
  for (let i = a;i <= b; i++) {
    x = x + ' ' + i; 
  }
  return x;
}   
 ```
